### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with around ten years of well-rounded experience, I've contributed to any kind of projects in different companies, and also I work as a freelancer web developer from time to time.

ðŸ”­ Lately I've been working at a it consulting company, collaborating as a fullstack developer on a iot related project, learning a bit more about react.js, node.js, nsq, gcp, git, and dates in javascript.
