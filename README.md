### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer with more than ten years of well-rounded experience, I've contributed to any kind of projects in different companies, and also I work as a freelancer web developer from time to time.

🔭 Lately, I’ve been working primarily with JavaScript/TypeScript and progressively expanding my experience in AI development, building LLM-based workflows and agents using LangChain and LangGraph.
